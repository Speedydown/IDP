Move Commands.

In order to send move-messages to the spider we are using the following format to give the spider
directions; 'move **', ** are two numbers which correspond with a direction or command.

The directions are (in the two number combination):

10 - stop
11 - forward
12 - right-forward
13 - right
14 - right-backwards
15 - backwards
16 - left-backwards
17 - left
18 - left-forward

Later commands will start at 20.
